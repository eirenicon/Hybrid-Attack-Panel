# Hybrid Attack Panel (HAP)

**Hybrid Attack Panel (HAP)** is a focused intelligence initiative within the Ardens research framework. It tracks, documents, and analyzes hybrid threats ‚Äî actions that blur the lines between war and peace, physical and digital, state and non-state actors.

This repository contains the HAP core structure:  
- Signal typologies  
- Feed indexes  
- Real-world hybrid incident logs  
- Scripts for semi-automated data ingestion and analysis  
- Planned dashboards and alert systems

## Why HAP?

Hybrid threats are not anomalies ‚Äî they are the new baseline.  
Understanding them requires more than snapshots; it demands pattern recognition across fractured, asynchronous signals.

HAP is designed to:

- Track emerging attack patterns in real time  
- Identify overlaps between cyber, physical, and psychological fronts  
- Normalize fragmented OSINT into actionable insights  
- Build and maintain a panel for visibility and trend analysis

This is not a forecasting tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a grounding one.

## Current Capabilities

- üß± Typology: Our working map of hybrid attack modes  
- üì° Feed Index: Curated sources across threat domains  
- üóÇÔ∏è Live Activity Log: Human-vetted, date-stamped hybrid events  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Code Infrastructure (in progress): Scripts for feed parsing, signal tagging, and normalization

All early-stage. All open.

## Relationship to Ardens

HAP began as a research track within [Ardens](https://github.com/eirenicon/Ardens/wiki) ‚Äî a broader framework for AI-human collaboration in intelligence workflows. It remains deeply aligned with Ardens‚Äô principles: symmetry of insight, transparency of process, and actionability of results.
