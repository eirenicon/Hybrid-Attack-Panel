## üóÇ Data Contributions

We maintain a **[Live Activity Log](docs/activity-log.md)** of hybrid threat incidents, manually curated for now. You can contribute entries by:

1. Forking the repo and editing `docs/activity-log.md`  
2. Adding a new row in the existing table with:
    - **Date**
    - **Event Type**
    - **Region**
    - **Source (linked)**
    - **Signal Category** (from [typology](docs/typology.md))
    - **Brief Notes**
3. Submitting a pull request with the updated file

Alternatively, open a GitHub issue with the details and we‚Äôll format it for you.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Contributions

We are building tools for:

- Ingesting and parsing data feeds

Please see the `src/` directory for the current structure.

If you're submitting a script:
- Prefer Python 3.10+
- Follow PEP8 style guidelines
- Include a docstring and test if possible
- Use open-source libraries where applicable
- Avoid hard-coded API keys or credentials

For new features, feel free to open a discussion or issue before you code.

You can help us by:

- Improving clarity in `docs/`
- Translating typology definitions into other languages
- Suggesting refinements to categories
- Providing field-specific or geopolitical context

Even a thoughtful paragraph can shape our framing ‚Äî don‚Äôt underestimate the value of brief, grounded input.

## üß≠ Community Standards

We expect all contributors to follow the spirit of:

- Transparency over obfuscation
